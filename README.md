Let's Play with the Boilerplate
The purpose of this lab is simple: to get the boilerplate working on your computer! Use the reference in this topic to help get you going.

Steps
Clone the Boilerplate from this repo.
Remove the hidden .git file in your newly cloned project.
Install all necessary dependencies.
Run the server and make sure you can see the "Hello World" at localhost:3000/.
Push this to your own Github repo
Optional
This Boilerplate is written in TypeScript, which you may not have covered yet. If so, play around with the Boilerplate and make your own custom Hello World page to get a feel for the build process and React TypeScript.

Otherwise, head on to the TypeScript videos!
